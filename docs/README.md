---

## üöÄ Project Overview

PrismBot is an **Active AI Powered Android Monitoring Overlay System** designed for **privacy, personalization, and efficiency**. Unlike cloud-dependent bots, it runs the **LLAMA language model directly on-device**, ensuring all conversations and user data remain private.

At its core, PrismBot uses a **lightweight base model optimized for mobile devices** together with a modular **adapter system** that allows instant switching between specialized roles such as study help, coding assistant, travel planner, or wellness coach ‚Äî all without retraining.

The app also features **smart fine-tuning** which updates active adapters automatically during idle or charging states, making the chatbot contextually aware and personalized over time.
